JZSMinesweeper
==============

This is a minesweeper clone i've made for the psp using the OneLua player


**Installation**
  - Replace all of the lua files in the bin dir with the ones in the root dir
  - Copy ``/bin/`` into ``PSP/GAME/`` and rename it to JZSMinesweeper
---
**TODO**: Improve performance
